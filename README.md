# Fontawesome field for Drupal 8

Provides a [Fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) icon picking field based on [chrisrikli's sandboxed module](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/chrisrikli/2376759) for D7.

Currently has no dependencies on `libraries` and instead attaches CDN resources (for [fontawesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/) and [select2](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/select2)) to the field widget.
